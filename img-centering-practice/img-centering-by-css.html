		<p class="pera">Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic 
			and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the 
			Partition of India in 1947 as part of a Muslim union with Pakistan, 
			which it separated from in 1971.[27] The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. 
			Ancient Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a bastion of pre-Islamic kingdoms. 
			Muslim conquests after 1204 heralded the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which 
			an independent Bengal Sultanate and a wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the 
			region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. 
			After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the maximum extent of British Bengal 
			stretched from the Khyber Pass in the west to Singapore in the east.[28][29] 
			The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the 
			emergence of Bangladesh. The All India Muslim League was founded in Dhaka 
			in 1906.[30] In 1940, the first Prime Minister of Bengal, A. K. 
			Fazlul Huq, supported the Lahore Resolution. Before the partition of 
			Bengal, a Bengali sovereign state was first proposed by premier H. S. 
			Suhrawardy. A referendum and the announcement of the Radcliffe Line 
			established the present-day territorial boundary.
